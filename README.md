# dhcp-helper

This DHCP relay agent is originally written by Simon Kelley
<simon@thekelleys.org.uk>

DHCP Relay Agents are commonly used on routed networks with
centralized DHCP services. The relay agent is a service that is
typically configured on a router and converts DHCP broadcasts into
unicast messages directed at the DHCP servers IP address.

dhcp-helper listens for DHCP and BOOTP broadcasts on configured
interfaces and relays them to DHCP or BOOTP servers elsewhere. It also
relays replies from the remote servers back to the configured
hosts. Once hosts are fully configured they can communicate directly
with their servers and no longer need the services of a relay.

dhcp-helper is optimized to run on a VLAN aware bridge, but work as well
for a much simpler use case (see simple.json). If running with a bridge
nftables is required (kernel support and userspace binary). This to stop
DHCP packets that's already processed by the relay agent to be forwarded
by the bridge.

dhcp-helper requires a configuration file to operate correctly (default
read from `/etc/dhcphelper.json` or specified via the `-f`
option). The simplest configuration look like this:
```
{
    "server": [
        {
            "address": "198.19.10.2"
        }],
    "groups": [
        {
            "giaddr": "198.19.20.1"
        }
    ]
}
```

This configuration will listen for DHCP request on the local interface
which has the IP address 198.19.20.1. An incoming DHCP request will
then be relayed to a DHCP server at IP address 198.19.10.2.

# Configuration

simple.json - A very simple case where you only run the relay agent on one interface and no bridge.
bridged.json - More advanced case with multiple servers and running on a VLAN aware bridge.

### Configuration file
**option82** - Should option 82 be enabled, optional
  * **remote-id** - remote ID settings, optional
    * **type** - remote id type can either be manual [string or hex values](#string-or-hex-values), hostname or giaddr
    * **data** - only applicable when using manual

**servers** - array of servers, optional
  * **address** - IPv4 address of server, required
  * **port** - TCP port for the server, optional (default port 67)

**groups** - array of objects, required
  * **giaddr** - Local address to use when communicate with server, required
  * **ifname** - interface to broadcast answers to, if not specified it is the interface with giaddr, optional
  * **ifaces** - array of objects, optional
    * **ifname** - the name of the interface, required
    * **circuit-id** - value to send to the server, see [String or hex values](#string-or-hex-values)
    * **server** - object of objects, optional if specified globally, override global configured servers
        * **address** - Where to send, required
        * **port** - TCP port for the server, optional (default port 67)

### String or hex values
Circuit-id and remote-id can be entered as hex values as well as string.

As raw hex values:
```
    "option82": {
        "remote-id": {
            "type": "manual",
            "data": [
                "0x5a",
                "0x5a",
                "0x5a",
                "0x5a"
            ]
        }
    },
```
as a string:
```
    "option82": {
        "remote-id": {
            "type": "manual",
            "data": "test"
        }
    },
```
